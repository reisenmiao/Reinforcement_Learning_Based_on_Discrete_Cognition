# Reinforcement_Learning_Based_on_Discrete_Cognition

### Reinforcement Learning based on Discrete Cognition
It gives the base concept of this project. We mark it a concept_0.

### The General Form of the Full Connected Network 
It gives the General form of full connected learning network, based on:
- the concept_0;
- the discover that the network learns a funtion based on the local linearity of that function;
- the target of a learning network is tends to simulate of a function instead of predicting something.

### A Review of the Learning network of XOR
It descripts a full process of writing a learning network of XOR by hand and includes some ideas coming out to mind during this process.
