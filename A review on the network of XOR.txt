A review on the network of XOR

For XOR, we have (0, 0) -> 0, (0, 1) -> 1, (1, 0) -> 1, (1, 1) -> 0

So we set 0 represents (0, 0), 1 represents (0, 1) and so on.

We mark f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 0, and draw the graph of f(x)

Then, we will see there are 3 setline in the graph, which means f(x) is consisted by 3 line structure.

So we need 3 elements in the mid layer.

According to uniform given above, we can have a network like this:

......

and now you can ckeck if it correct.

For a network with original input, there is two dimension.
The linierty of a two dimension is a surface.
And we can see there is two surface in the paragraph of XOR, so we need two elements in mid layers. 
And the network which given by the book works as follows:
From x to mid layer, it build a surface random, then change one of a point.
From mid layer to y, it is a linear surface.

To a sumary, we can say that the network simulate a funtion based on the local linarity of the function.
